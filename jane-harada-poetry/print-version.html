        <h3>Poets can be thrifty souls</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Poets can be thrifty souls, saving scraps of joy and sorrow
carefully fitting broken pieces into their kaleidoscopes
walking along sunlit paths near woods, daring to enter,
to play in the sweep of towering trees
study the meticulous hearts of flowers
learn about the tickling and passion of love
and yet sometimes they lose everything
except an extravagant faith in their art</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">2</span>
        <h3>I'm American</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I am deepened by the bravery
of my immigrant grandparents
who left comfortable, koto-playing lives
and endured working as gardeners
for racists like Fred Astaire
who knew he could dance away
without ever paying them
when they only wanted
to buy a box of oranges
all their food for a week

And I admire my pioneer parents
going eastward from Manzanar
to Michigan during World War II
where tomatoes were thrown at them
while they waited for buses
and yet still succeeded
in giving their children
a sense of humor and a global view

And I appreciate a cultural heritage
of ancient, meticulous rock gardens
with carefully raked waves
yet it's also part of my problem
for at the shore I like to hear
the low rumble of the sea
roll in the warm sand
jump in the waves
and feel it's only natural

I especially like
Chief Seattle's speech
the majestic Iliad
Rabelais' humor
Tolstoy's War and Peace
Richard Wright's Black Boy
And Twain's "Leaping Frog"

I like the freedom to do
what I think is important:
to work against climate change
to stamp my foot
on the marble floor of a mansion
owned by people with factories
badly polluting the air

And I stare at an elegant kimono
woven one silk strand at a time
hanging next to a large abstract painting
created with a broom by my best friend
who immigrated here from Latvia</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">3</span>
        <h3>Changing directions</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">With head bent, intent
I start to climb alone
focused only on
getting to the top

Arms start swinging
fists go up and down
mechanically
in front of my face
as I walk faster and faster
with exaggerated gusto

And then suddenly
my elbows bump my sides
and I start to laugh,
let go, and giggle

I turn around, spread
my imaginary wings
glide back down
to the valley where
friends and family
will laugh with me</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">4</span>
        <h3>Flittering</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Take away the sunâ€”no matter
For you leave me flittering about the day
Like an old girl gone mad
Tilting with my broom
Gazing at glittering dust
Almost forgetting to sweep</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">5</span>
        <h3>For my grandmother</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">When I hear a lady sing
while playing a samisen
joy comes in remembering
that here in a foreign land
in words I barely understood
my grandmother sang to me
about children everywhere
joining hands in friendship</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">6</span>
        <h3>Winter contentment</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">How lucky we are
as we grow old
to sit together
on a park bench
listening to birds
trill in the air
or icicles clattering
in sudden refrains
while we simply
add arpeggios
when memory fails</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">7</span>
        <h3>Janis Joplin's scream</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">They worked door to door in '64
registering voters and singing
"We shall overcome"
marching against war
burning draft cards
joining hands to change America

And then there was bewilderment
when MLK, RFK, and students
at Kent State protesting war
were shot and killed

Yet I wonder why they
threw up their hands
and headed out to California
looking for marijuana
and Janis Joplin's scream
while history kept
giving them chances
chances rarely given
to change America for good</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">8</span>
        <h3>Remembering summer as a child</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">In summer we cross through
Fields of grasses arching
As they move in the breeze
Searching for wild pear trees
So far never found
And when we stop to rest
Toss pine cones into streams
And dream of where they go</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">9</span>
        <h3>For Millennia</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">The long heavy rain stops
and the sky is cleansed into
a crystalline shade of blue
recalling the pristine world
native people in America
preserved for millennia

We've broken every treaty
made with Native people
to take more land where
we keep piling on plastic
which breaks into tiny pieces
lasting for millennia</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">10</span>
        <h3>Vacation</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">What freedom to walk slowly
away from old routines
into the changing shoreline
with its lacy waves receding
to an unknown place in the sea
where we can dream a little
while gazing at palm branches
brushing against the sun</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">11</span>
        <h3>A teacher's reward</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">During the last class of the year
I call on students with raised hands
grow more and more pleased
with their questioning
until I excuse myself
and step into the cool corridor
to collect my thoughts
savor a teacher's reward
and recall with a smile
the first day of class
when they switched off the lights
and threw erasers at me</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">12</span>
        <h3>Song maker</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">My love sails away
in his search
for another sea, another song
and though his sailboat
is moored far away
whistling wind carries
a knocking sound
of halyards and mast
in a clanging song
that I sing to him--
Sailor, song maker
Fare thee well
Fare thee well</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">13</span>
        <h3>Your last wish</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">At the cemetery
peacefulness
restores me once
ten times it drives me mad
for our love feels
permanently fastened
like fossil on rock
and your death
a painful severing

I recall our love as a
deep synchronization
in two lives
that gave us joy
out of all proportion
and I will honor
your last wish
to keep sunlight
somewhere before me</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">14</span>
        <h3>The day we fell in love</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">If the gods or you or I
should end this dream,
let me recall the day
we fell in love
how we kept walking
anywhere

Buildings, other people
simply disappeared
and above us
seagulls were soaring
their wings going stiff
as if in awe of
all our flight</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">15</span>
        <h3>A perfect June day</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Sprawling under a tree
we laugh so hard
that I begin to
roll off your belly
and must hold you
even tighter
while all about us
poppies flutter
on this perfect June day
from which we may
someday measure
every other</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">16</span>
        <h3>Friend and artist</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">She announces that we're all stupid
and that she's not drunk
narrows her eyes to show that she means it
curses art in front of his friends
until they leave

He sits back down without being asked
and intently listens to her
then shoulders her home through fresh snow
slips a painting under her arm
for he knows she's broke again</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">17</span>
        <h3>The day my father died</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">After my father died
I went down to the sea
where waves suggest
there are no straight lines
or answers
only swirls, undulations

Going in to swim
I free myself from
the specificity
of placing one foot
in front of the other
at a funeral

I move in any direction
on a whim and enjoy
the translucent colors
under the water

I recall my father
struggling for us
his single-mindedness
like the last bright leaf
in an autumn storm
twisting in the wind
but not letting go

Leaning back I gaze
at the horizon
water meeting sky
to eternity
where my father
his love and strength
stay with me</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">18</span>
        <h3>A kiss between words</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">One evening while in college
you saunter over to talk
and we proceed seriously
to share insights from the day

You tell me how Gogol's character
walked very carefully
so that he wouldn't
wear out his shoes

We laugh into the night
wishing to kiss between words
or press palm against palm
as we finally say good night</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">19</span>
        <h3>Women's lib is coming along</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I'm so truly unbearable that you would be pleased
As I thrum my fingers on the table
And give my teeth-clenched, eyes-closed, very quick
Side-to-side headshake of complete exasperation
Whenever a man tries to put me down

But there's one little problem I've discovered:
Fellas scare kinda easy these days
So while you're out there on the beach
Having your fun pulling down swimming trunks
Let me know if you run across a man
With a little chest sticking out
Send him along for me to check out</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">20</span>
        <h3>Stars Glitter Along Bare Branches</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Planting a young cherry tree
outside my window
in memory of a friend
I daydream about
blossoming spring,
shiny red fruit in summer

At night, however, deer eat
all the leaves of the tree
and during the next night
listening to the wind
thinking I hear returning deer
I jump up, sweep the curtain aside
ready to startle the bandits

Instead, stars glitter along bare branches
wind swirls the tree into a dance
of silhouettes over the ground
letting me see a another world
with the beauty of deer in the moonlight</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">21</span>
        <h3>Oblivious to any chill in the air</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">As children In woods hushed by a winter storm
we stretch way out and lean on our elbows
to watch bright cardinals flicking snow
completely oblivious to any chill in the air</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">22</span>
        <h3>The morning sky</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Early this morning
light from the east streams out
and rosy shadows creep
over enormous, billowing,
delicate-edged clouds
set against a pale, blue sky
and I believe my friend
who painted beautifully
on large canvases before
is now in charge of all the sky
where memories of our laughter
our frowning and smiling
drift with magnificent clouds
of the morning sky</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">23</span>
        <h3>Van Gogh's drawing</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Thousands of times
I have looked at the lines
In Van Gogh's pen and ink drawing
of hospital grounds at Arles
finding every single stroke of his pen
every single line, every single line
is part of a harmonious whole
in his stunning definition of beauty</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">24</span>
        <h3>An ancient amphitheater</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I sit in an ancient theater in Arles
the first one I have ever seen
and realize how for many years
I have been searching for this place
where mankind once came together
to hear passionate ideas ring out

Columns, stairs, places to sit
carefully chiseled from massive rock
by people who clearly knew
how essential communities are

I daydream about the future
when every community creates
places to meet, seeks understanding
of one another, of ideas,
until everyone shrugs off war
as outdated, inhuman, absurd</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">25</span>
        <h3>On the way back</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">In a hospital there are cardiac,
pediatric, obstetric wards and more
and he's in a psychiatric ward
trying to get out of depression,
back to his former self

He follows the ward's routine for weeks
talks to doctors, nurses, anyone
as he tries to make connections with people
stay alert to their nods of assent or dissent
even though he doesn't want to

Christmas carolers come to sing
and as they leave he marvels
at their strength to walk out of the ward
while confusion, what to do next,
paralyzes him, keeps him inside of himself

Sometimes he feels like a crab
on the ocean floor waiting all day
for warm currents, feelings
to take him back to a familiar shore

One night in bed he hears staff
talking in the hallway
and their words fall on him
like raindrops from the world he left
and suddenly he remembers how much
he once loved springtime

Tears slip down his cheeks
and he grabs at them, at these precious
milestones of feeling
and hoping that he will make it back
smiles broadly into the darkness</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">26</span>
        <h3>Rain</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I like the thoroughness of rain
water reaching every root
the scope of a storm
our world hushed for an hour
people left gazing at the landscape
billowing and bending</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">27</span>
        <h3>Rippling the Pond</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Amid floating leaves
on firmly arched stems
the petals of water lilies
open to the sun
rippling the pond

And I think of youth
sound asleep on rugs
protest guitars on bellies
awakening among friends
bumping strings into hums</div>
    </div>

        <h3>There was once a golden age of the working class</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">We stop lifting
beam after beam,
put down hammers, saws--
reach for lunch pails,
start strutting across streets
with the sun on our faces
walking slowly
back on our heels
joking, showing off
on our way to the park
pleased with our work

Forty or more years ago
before the President broke
strike after strike
and unions lost ground
we lived in a golden age
of the working class --
hammering, sawing
building neighborhoods
walking to homes we owned
talking about our kids
how we were making
a good future for them</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Tulips and irises</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Tulip petals
bend way back from the stem
lean in six different directions
almost break off

The young live like this
in a bright, mad dance

Irises sway
standing amid sleek leaves
with blue sails fluttering
in the breeze

The elderly are elegant
even if slightly bent</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Explaining the sea</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I would like to start over again
with someone young,
as easy to love as you
yet I cannot explain the sea
nor will I draw you
out of the pristine world
of innocence</div>

        <h3>At the opening</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">The artist looks around
greets everyone
and circles his work

His magnificent sculpture
is steady while critics
move about like flies
and leave silently

He grips, cracks a wine glass
In his hand yet still stands
Smiling and bleeding</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Utter refinement</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Musicians take their places
finish tuning their instruments
the conductor comes forth
chandeliers slowly dim
and a raucous world disappears

The first clear notes arise
and I clasp my hands in gratitude
for this utter refinement
surviving centuries of chaos
and even the horrors of war</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Watching the sun</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">When our mother died
a great cloud curtain
rushed to the horizon
and misted light
in golden lavender
soft as rose petals
streamed down

Watching the sun
its molten red
pressing against
the unknown night
we think of her
how she will always
extend our days</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Youthfulness</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">By day we splash, snap towels at each other
stay alert to any chance for mischief
under the wide open skies of America

On a first date we try to slide into each other
as the car swerves, giggle and later
try to kiss and grin at the same time</div>
    </div>

        <h3>Open fields in the Midwest</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">May no one ever
decide what to do
with these last open fields
fleckering
the rural Midwest
where dewberries glisten
after summer rain
and warm breaths of air
arise from earth
like prayer</div>
    </div>

        <span class="poem-number">36</span>
        <h3>Contrasts in white</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Poplars shimmered white at dawn
when our fingers caressed
like a thousand leaves
and we slid together
curve unto curve
in smooth youth

Now, old and rough-branched,
moving slowly as if
on crusted snow, we turn
to embrace one another
under white, uncertain skies,
and sleep in faint sunlight</div>
    </div>

        <span class="poem-number">37</span>
        <h3>My first love leaves me</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">With the sweet sting
of strawberries
pressed on my tongue
I sit at the table
staring at the white rose bud
he gave me last night

I sniff the tilting bloom
watch it spread one petal
like an awkward wing
while out the window
a faint crescent moon
crosses a pale blue sky
and out of spring</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">38</span>
        <h3>Your hand waits</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Your hand presses
up my body's side
and waits
and this waiting,
this gentle gesture
like a steady sun
behind fast moving clouds
allows us to consider
who we are
to one another

Your smile ripples
into my thoughts
moves me toward you
my dress slips off
as we step out of clothes
shudder slightly
in the cool air
sway inwardly
and surrender
to one another</div>
    </div>

        <h3>A boy in spring</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Crocuses thrust
Their bright leaves
Up from the ground
Like crossed swords
Heralding spring
When a young boy
Hops on a bicycle
Looking for hills to coast
And pedals quickly
With all his might
To go anywhere
And nowhere special</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">40</span>
        <h3>Sending a kiss into the universe</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Sprawling regally
after our splendor
unable to contain my joy
I move from under your shoulder
tilt my head back
and send an open kiss
into the universe
and dream
of burning a hole
through a black map of stars
to form a new star
for you, for love of you</div>
    </div>

        <h3>However briefly</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Back in my hometown
I wander over to the high school
recalling the rippling laughter
amid clanging locker doors
and how we once cheered
on sunlit playing fields
where we felt immortal

Today my friend Dave
arrived home from war
wrapped in a flag
and at the town green
surrounded by silent churches
I think of what we might have said
before he left for West Point

Tears fall for awhile
until I imagine how Dave
would make jokes right now
to take my pain away
and so I leave our hometown
grateful for the innocence allowed us
however briefly</div>
    </div>

        <h3>For my son</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I am floating
on milk white clouds
moving at the pace of sleep
glancing back
to bid you farewell

Your life's been my
long dream of love
so sing a song
go ring a bell
all is well</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">43</span>
        <h3>We turned to go in</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I sit tossing out
crumpled rose petals
from the bottom of a drawer
lists I kept of what I laughed about
while you were on some trip

And I'll always remember
wandering with you
on sunlit paths near woods
the splendor--
because we turned to go in</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">44</span>
        <h3>Old friends</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I sit and fondly recall
how through the years
your voice ranged back
over our lives
like rolling waves
churning shiny pebbles
to find past incidents
that worked out all right
and comforted me

In your absence
I wish you could see
these wisps of fog
drift up and slowly float
around a majestic tree where
birds on topmost branches
sit easily and sway
flick tails and fly away
still calling to each other</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">45</span>
        <h3>A social dilemma</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">I should have nodded at her,
I told myself,
yet I did not feel I could
Is that really so?
Yes. No. Maybe so.
But then again and sometimes even again
I think, rather convincingly, or so it seems,
I should have nodded at her nevertheless
I knew her name, street and house
and sitting on her couch had sipped tea
It was too late now
for I didn't give my eyes
that soothing glint of recognition,
but remained where I was</div>
    </div>

        <span class="poem-number">46</span>
        <h3>A child in autumn</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">We stay busy all day in autumn
jumping into piles of fallen leaves
enjoying the crisp, crunching sounds
stretching way back on the dry ground
to look at orange maple trees
against the bright blue sky
jump up to search for hickory nuts
rush home with bulging pockets
to crack and share their sweet meat</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">47</span>
        <h3>A parent's plea</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Suddenly there's snow
blowing in gusts
as I gather up my baby
and drive as fast as I can
to the hospital
grateful for bits of mud
on the icy road

Clutching the wheel
and stopping my tears
that would blur vision
I quietly sing a lullaby
while my mind searches
for everything I know
about first aid

His raspy breathing
scratches against my heart
like branches against windows
his delicate, flame-like life
dances before me
and I only know
that it must not go out
I silently plead for his life
in the waiting room
promise to give up
anything, everything</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">48</span>
        <h3>Playing a cello that is not there</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">After his funeral guests depart
wind and rain tip flower heads
and outside she sits down
to play a cello that is not there

Her skirt spreads, lace begins to show
until she slips to the ground
like a delicate fern
splattering in heavy rain</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-page">
        <span class="poem-number">49</span>
        <h3>Alone</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">In my walk
without you
I try whistling,
going on
while sounds of pebbles
crunching underfoot
stop when I stop
and remind me
that I'm alone

Suddenly,
wild irises flare
along the dull path
again and again
they flare
leaving me
with exclamations
I want to make
to you</div>

        <h3>Multicultural America</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Asian-looking Americans may be
fifth generation citizens of the U.S.A.
and still asked, "Where are you from?"
instead of, "Are you from around here?"

The stack of deposit slips was gone
so I went to ask a bank officer where to get one
and told to get in line like everyone else
I wonder: Racial prejudice? Someone with a bad day?

The clerk at the supermarket greets each person
through the line except me because he thinks
I don't speak English --so let's keep working
to understand a multicultural America</div>

        <h3>Poetry was practice</h3>
        <div class="poem-content">Now tossing out lists I kept
of what I laughed about
while you were gone
and crumpled old roses petals
at the bottom of my drawer
I recall a sunlit path
splendor when we turned to go in
and slowly I sense how
poetry was practice
for summoning imagination
now that you are gone</div>

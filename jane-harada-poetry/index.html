Poets can be thrifty souls, saving scraps of joy and sorrow
carefully fitting broken pieces into their kaleidoscopes
walking along sunlit paths near woods, daring to enter,
to play in the sweep of towering trees
study the meticulous hearts of flowers
learn about the tickling and passion of love
and yet sometimes they lose everything
except an extravagant faith in their art

                    <div class="poem-text">
I am deepened by the bravery
of my immigrant grandparents
who left comfortable, koto-playing lives
and endured working as gardeners
for racists like Fred Astaire
who knew he could dance away
without ever paying them
when they only wanted
to buy a box of oranges
all their food for a week

And I admire my pioneer parents
going eastward from Manzanar
to Michigan during World War II
where tomatoes were thrown at them
while they waited for buses
and yet still succeeded
in giving their children
a sense of humor and a global view

And I appreciate a cultural heritage
of ancient, meticulous rock gardens
with carefully raked waves
yet it's also part of my problem
for at the shore I like to hear
the low rumble of the sea
roll in the warm sand
jump in the waves
and feel it's only natural

I especially like
Chief Seattle's speech
the majestic Iliad
Rabelais' humor
Tolstoy's War and Peace
Richard Wright's Black Boy
And Twain's "Leaping Frog"

I like the freedom to do
what I think is important:
to work against climate change
to stamp my foot
on the marble floor of a mansion
owned by people with factories
badly polluting the air

And I stare at an elegant kimono
woven one silk strand at a time
hanging next to a large abstract painting
created with a broom by my best friend
who immigrated here from Latvia

With head bent, intent
I start to climb alone
focused only on
getting to the top

Arms start swinging
fists go up and down
mechanically
in front of my face
as I walk faster and faster
with exaggerated gusto

And then suddenly
my elbows bump my sides
and I start to laugh,
let go, and giggle

I turn around, spread
my imaginary wings
glide back down
to the valley where
friends and family
will laugh with me

How lucky we are

They worked door to door in '64
registering voters and singing
"We shall overcome"
marching against war
burning draft cards
joining hands to change America

And then there was bewilderment
when MLK, RFK, and students
at Kent State protesting war
were shot and killed

Yet I wonder why they
threw up their hands
and headed out to California
looking for marijuana
and Janis Joplin's scream
while history kept
giving them chances
chances rarely given
to change America for good

the translucent colors

struggling for us
his single-mindedness
like the last bright leaf
in an autumn storm
twisting in the wind
but not letting go

Leaning back I gaze
at the horizon
water meeting sky

where my father
his love and strength
stay with me

thinking I hear returning deer
I jump up, sweep the curtain aside
ready to startle the bandits

Instead, stars glitter along bare branches
wind swirls the tree into a dance
of silhouettes over the ground
letting me see a another world

by people who clearly knew
how essential communities are

places to meet, seeks understanding
of one another, of ideas,

In a hospital there are cardiac,
pediatric, obstetric wards and more
and he's in a psychiatric ward
trying to get out of depression,
back to his former self

He follows the ward's routine for weeks
talks to doctors, nurses, anyone
as he tries to make connections with people
stay alert to their nods of assent or dissent
even though he doesn't want to

Christmas carolers come to sing
and as they leave he marvels
at their strength to walk out of the ward
while confusion, what to do next,
paralyzes him, keeps him inside of himself

Sometimes he feels like a crab
on the ocean floor waiting all day
for warm currents, feelings
to take him back to a familiar shore

One night in bed he hears staff
talking in the hallway
and their words fall on him
like raindrops from the world he left
and suddenly he remembers how much
he once loved springtime

Tears slip down his cheeks
and he grabs at them, at these precious
milestones of feeling
and hoping that he will make it back

I sit and fondly recall
how through the years
your voice ranged back
over our lives
like rolling waves
churning shiny pebbles
to find past incidents
that worked out all right
and comforted me

In your absence
I wish you could see
these wisps of fog
drift up and slowly float
around a majestic tree where
birds on topmost branches
sit easily and sway
flick tails and fly away
still calling to each other

I should have nodded at her,
I told myself,
yet I did not feel I could
Is that really so?
Yes. No. Maybe so.
But then again and sometimes even again
I think, rather convincingly, or so it seems,
I should have nodded at her nevertheless
I knew her name, street and house
and sitting on her couch had sipped tea
It was too late now
for I didn't give my eyes
that soothing glint of recognition,
but remained where I was

We stay busy all day in autumn
jumping into piles of fallen leaves
enjoying the crisp, crunching sounds
stretching way back on the dry ground
to look at orange maple trees
against the bright blue sky
jump up to search for hickory nuts
rush home with bulging pockets
to crack and share their sweet meat

Suddenly there's snow
blowing in gusts
as I gather up my baby
and drive as fast as I can
to the hospital
grateful for bits of mud
on the icy road

Clutching the wheel
and stopping my tears
that would blur vision
I quietly sing a lullaby
while my mind searches
for everything I know
about first aid

His raspy breathing
scratches against my heart
like branches against windows
his delicate, flame-like life
dances before me
and I only know
that it must not go out
I silently plead for his life
in the waiting room
promise to give up
anything, everything

After his funeral guests depart
wind and rain tip flower heads
and outside she sits down
to play a cello that is not there

Her skirt spreads, lace begins to show
until she slips to the ground
like a delicate fern
splattering in heavy rain

In my walk
without you
I try whistling,
going on
while sounds of pebbles
crunching underfoot
stop when I stop
and remind me
that I'm alone

Suddenly,
wild irises flare
along the dull path
again and again
they flare
leaving me
with exclamations
I want to make
to you

Asian-looking Americans may be
fifth generation citizens of the U.S.A.
and still asked, "Where are you from?"
instead of, "Are you from around here?"

The stack of deposit slips was gone
so I went to ask a bank officer where to get one
and told to get in line like everyone else
I wonder: Racial prejudice? Someone with a bad day?

The clerk at the supermarket greets each person
through the line except me because he thinks
I don't speak English --so let's keep working
to understand a multicultural America

Now tossing out lists I kept
of what I laughed about
while you were gone
and crumpled old roses petals
at the bottom of my drawer
I recall a sunlit path
splendor when we turned to go in
and slowly I sense how
poetry was practice
for summoning imagination
now that you are gone
